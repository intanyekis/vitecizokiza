He gains most of his clout on social media from acting out when it comes to sports-related events.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Is Jackson Mahomes Known For?</strong></h2><p>Short answer? Being a bit of a public nuisance.&nbsp;</p><p>The TikTok star quickly capitalized on having a front-row seat to most of the country’s biggest sporting events, courtesy of his older brother.</p><p>Acting out in public is just a way for him to gain attention on social media, be it good or bad.</p><p>He had been seen pouring water on Ravens fans after they taunted him in September.&nbsp;</p><p>In Washington earlier this year, Mahomes was heavily criticized for dancing on the journey number of the late Sean Taylor, who was shot and killed during a home invasion in 2007.</p><p>NFL fans had been calling for his jersey number to be retired since his untimely death, and their wishes were finally granted in October this year.</p><p>Mahomes posted a TikTok where he danced directly on the number decal. A Twitter user <a href=#>reposted</a> the video, calling it disrespectful to the late footballer.</p><p>Mahomes tweeted his apology, claiming he was told to stand there and meant no disrespect to Taylor or his family.</p><p>His apology was not well-received. Twitter users <a href=#>noted</a> that it was shameful of the entire Mahomes crew to be standing on the number at all, given it had been blocked off with ropes.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody knows why they were told to stand there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The SoT Bar Incident</strong></h2><p>SoT has been hailed as one of Kansas City’s best bars. The high-end downtown establishment has housed many famous patrons over the years, but the younger Mahomes was the first one to be publicly named and shamed.&nbsp;</p><p>In spite of the sketchy details, Mahomes certainly rubbed the bar staff the wrong way.</p><p>He informed his followers in a now-deleted Instagram story that<strong> “the service is absolutely terrible and the servers are so rude.”</strong></p><p>He went on to repost responses from followers who agreed with his assessment of the establishment.</p><p>His followers immediately attacked SoT on their social media platforms, prompting them to post a brutal response to Mahomes’ claims.</p><p><a href=#>The New York Post</a> reported that SoT staff issued the following statement under the guise of an apology to Mahomes on their Facebook page:</p><p><strong>“We are sorry that we set boundaries that you tried to ignore,”</strong> it began. <strong>“Oftentimes people with un-earned status and a sense of entitlement think they are above the rules and will lash out at the employee enforcing them.”</strong></p><p>Staff agreed that they were unable to seat Mahomes and his group, attributing it to the lack of space available.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“We are sorry that you have the reach that you do, or at least that you think you do and that instead of using it for something positive you decided to use it to try and crush a small <a href=#>business</a>. We survived a global pandemic, we’ll survive your ego.”</strong></p><p>The post has since been deleted.</p><p>A <a href=#>later post</a> reflected on the non-apology, apologizing to patrons for lashing out.</p><p>It reads:</p><p><strong>“The team at SoT is committed to providing every guest that walks through our doors with the best experience possible, while treating them with respect and humility. Yesterday, we failed to meet those expectations.”</strong></p><p>The SoT team acknowledged the rash choice, saying that its social media was used to personally attack Mahomes’ character. They admit that the situation could have been handled better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We want everyone to know that we acknowledge our shortcomings in this situation, and even though we failed to meet our own–and we’re sure many of our follower’s–expectations with our social media presence yesterday, we promise to do better. To be better. To think before reacting. And most importantly, to use our following to bring the community we love so much together instead of being combative and dividing it. All each of us can do is try to be better than we were the day before.”</strong></p><p>Loyal customers are grateful for the acknowledgment that things got a little out of hand but remain proud of the bar for standing its ground as a local business.</p><p>Many commenters support the bar’s decision to do better and are happy that the staff was brave enough to call out the so-called influencer.</p><p>Mahomes is neither the first social media personality to cause chaos in public nor will he be the last.</p><p>The trend of acting up in public solely for attention has been around since the advent of social media, with these kinds of videos attracting millions of views.</p><p>Mahomes utilized his position as an immediate family member of a celebrity for his own benefit. His content could have been directed towards explaining the behind-the-scenes of the National Football League, as he has access to most places the ordinary fan would never be able to go.</p><p>Unfortunately, that kind of content is too mellow for the majority of TikTok users, who revel in influencers doing something in public that is worth scrutinizing later on.&nbsp;</p><p>Mahomes’ antics had been generating bad press for his brother and the Chiefs, who had been suffering a mid-season slump.</p><p><a href=#>CBSSports</a> reports that around the time Jackson Mahomes’ behavior was being discussed on social media, the team managed to break out of the slump to once again become the frontrunner of the AFC West title.&nbsp;</p><p>The upcoming game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Thursday presents a chance for the Chiefs to claim yet another division title, placing them at the top of the pack.</p><p>Hopefully, Mahomes learns from his third public offense this year. This seems unlikely, though, seeing as it generated him far more press than ordinary TikTok videos would.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2wJyirKeeYrqitM6mnKxllprCpb%2BMsKCtoF2grq%2B%2FwKxknKGkrnqjrdFo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjackson-mahomes-feuds-with-kansas-city-bar.html&text=The%20SoT%20Bar%20Has%20No%20Time%20For%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Antics%2c%20Responds%20Brutally%20To%20Claims%20Of%20Poor%20Service&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjackson-mahomes-feuds-with-kansas-city-bar.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjackson-mahomes-feuds-with-kansas-city-bar.html&title=The%20SoT%20Bar%20Has%20No%20Time%20For%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Antics%2c%20Responds%20Brutally%20To%20Claims%20Of%20Poor%20Service" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjackson-mahomes-feuds-with-kansas-city-bar.html&title=The%20SoT%20Bar%20Has%20No%20Time%20For%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Antics%2c%20Responds%20Brutally%20To%20Claims%20Of%20Poor%20Service" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjackson-mahomes-feuds-with-kansas-city-bar.html&title=The%20SoT%20Bar%20Has%20No%20Time%20For%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Antics%2c%20Responds%20Brutally%20To%20Claims%20Of%20Poor%20Service" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjackson-mahomes-feuds-with-kansas-city-bar.html&description=The%20SoT%20Bar%20Has%20No%20Time%20For%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Antics%2c%20Responds%20Brutally%20To%20Claims%20Of%20Poor%20Service" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-look-at-vladimir-putins-most-expensive-real-estate-purchases.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Look At Vladimir Putin's Most Expensive Real-Estate Purchases">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./patrizio-billio-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrizio Billio Obituary">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
