Myranda was a servant of House Bolton of the Dreadfort, daughter of the castle’s kennel master. She was one of Ramsay Snow’s bedwarmers and part-time helper in some of his torture sessions.</p><p>Myranda was a cruel, wily girl with an uncontrollable sadistic streak and sexual urges, which induces a combination thereof, especially throughout the way she assists in the torture of Bolton prisoners, making her equally as wild and sociopathic as her lover, Ramsay.</p><p>Myranda was deceitful, able to use her sexuality and soft-spoken demeanor to lull victims into a false sense of security before revealing her true nature. Seemingly shy, she does not rage or openly express, but derives a perverse pleasure from mutilating or murdering helpless victims.</p><p>Despite her sociopathic ways, Myranda does seem to genuinely care about Ramsay, even if he only saw her as a thing to entertain him and was willing to abandon her if she grew boring. She was naive enough, however, to believe him when he said the two would marry one day.</p><p>This may suggest her feelings for him maybe love, or simply misinterpreted as lust. Nevertheless, the relationship is not entirely black-and-white as Ramsay kept her around longer than most of his bedwarmers and even gave a eulogy, vowing revenge on those who killed her before telling Maester Wolkan to feed her corpse to the dogs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=miranda-richardson-tv-shows></span><span>Miranda Richardson Tv Shows</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Now That’s History!</li><li>The Thirties In Colour</li><li>Fantastic Flying Journey</li><li>The Scold’s Bridle Television show</li><li>Pinky Malinky</li><li>Operation Orangutan Film</li><li>Screen Two</li><li>Sorrell and Son</li><li>The Adventures of Bottle Top Bill and His Best Friend Corky</li><li>Curfew (TV series)</li><li>A Dance to the Music of Time</li><li>The True Adventures Of Christopher Columbus</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=miranda-richardson-death></span><span>Miranda Richardson Death</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Miranda is not yet dead.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=miranda-richardson-blackadder></span><span>Miranda Richardson Blackadder</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Miranda played a comedic Queen Elizabeth I, aka Queenie, in the British television comedy Blackadder II.
