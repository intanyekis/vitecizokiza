Unless that actor is <strong>Rob McElhenney</strong>. The star and creator of irreverent sitcom <strong>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</strong> famously changed his slim physique in the most dramatic way, not once but twice. As creator of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the longest running comedy in television history</a>, you'd think that McElhenney's character, Mac, would look better as the series progressed. But in keeping with his show's darkly comic humor, he had another idea planned entirely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny DeVito Saved This Show To Impress His Kids</a></span></p><p>In season 7 of the show, Mac gains a lot of weight. But by the next season, he is extremely slim and toned, becoming increasingly more muscular as the series progresses. So how exactly did Rob McElhenney gain and lose 60 lbs for the show? Keep reading to find out.</p><h2 id=gaining-weight-for-the-show-took-3-months><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Gaining Weight For The Show&nbsp;Took 3 Months</span></h2><p>It was in season 6 that Mac first started to show signs of&nbsp;subtle weight gain, but by the 7th season&nbsp;his weight gain made him&nbsp;near unrecognizable. McElhenney's rationale for creating "Fat Mac", as he is known, was to counter the sitcom cliché of characters getting better looking as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actors grow richer</a>, citing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a> as an example of this. The weight gain&nbsp;process took&nbsp;3 months, eventually taking McElhenney from 160 lbs to 220 lbs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-ate-5-000-calories-a-day><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Ate 5,000 Calories A Day</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-2.jpg><p>To gain the weight,&nbsp;McElhenney&nbsp;had to eat five 1,000 calorie meals a day. Initially, he tried eating chicken, rice, and vegetables, but he struggled to finish his meals and keep the heavy food down. That was, until he was offered a much easier solution...</p><h2 id=two-big-macs-for-mac><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Two Big Macs For Mac</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/069d6c0361e9d55ddba191514916e3e7ba54407c.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an appearance on actor Dax Shepard's&nbsp;podcast Armchair Expert, McElhenney explained that, á la Super Size Me, he indulged in Big Macs, which angered his doctor. "So, I went to my doctor, because I wanted to be monitored through the whole thing, because this is funny. And my doctor said: 'To be clear, this is not funny. Don't do this. This is really dangerous.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Dax Shepard Been Up To Since Parenthood?</a></span></p><p>Nevertheless, he chatted to a nutritionist, who suggested eating two Big Macs a day, to which&nbsp;McElhenney obliged, as they were much easier to eat than the aforementioned chicken, rice, and vegetables. As the actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained to Nick Kroll</a>, "you start to see the Big Mac and realize it's a lot easier to get down".</p><h2 id=drinking-ice-cream><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Drinking Ice-Cream</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/How_Mac_Got_Fat.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Rob McElhenney may not be the first - or last - actor to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dramatically change&nbsp;their weight for a role</a>, his process is certainly among the most ingenious and interesting. As he explained to Conan O'Brien, "The first 20 pounds was easy, honestly. The next 40 were tough."</p><p>But he found a solution: "I would have my assistant in the morning go out and buy... a gallon of ice-cream and he would put it out on the counter and I wouldn't eat it until 4 o'clock in the afternoon because it would melt and I would drink it."</p><h2 id=eating-cottage-cheese-at-2am-was-key><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Eating Cottage Cheese At 2am Was Key</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rob-mcelhenney-diet-gain-60-pounds-always-sunny.jpg><p>Cottage cheese doesn't have the most appetizing appearance, so eating it at 2am sounds absolutely nauseating. But that's exactly what&nbsp;McElhenney did to pile on the extra pounds, emphasising his commitment to his weight gain goal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But this was the key," he told Dax Shepard. "I read that cottage cheese metabolises really slow in your stomach, so if you eat cottage cheese, the last thing you want to do is eat it right before you go to bed... So, I started eating cottage cheese in the middle of the night. I would wake up at 2am and I would eat cottage cheese."</p><h2 id=but-soon-it-was-time-to-lose-the-weight><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>But Soon It Was Time To Lose The Weight</span></h2><p>Within a month, McElhenney was able to lose 23 lbs of the 60 lbs he had gained. Not too long afterwards, he lost the remaining pounds. But he was quite sad to let go of the extra weight, explaining that he actually enjoyed living in a larger body and didn't experience fatigue or other side effects from the weight gain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=getting-ripped-took-less-work><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Getting Ripped Took Less Work</span></h2><p>At the 2018 Los Angeles Pride Parade, McElhenney&nbsp;showed his support for LGBT+ rights&nbsp;alongside his wife Kaitlin Olson and co-star Danny DeVito. What shocked people the most was the fact that the formerly rotund actor was now totally ripped.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 TV Couples You Didn't Know Are Together In Real Life</a></span></p><p>McElhenney explained that losing the weight and getting ripped was actually a quicker process than gaining weight. "Losing it is easy. You just stop eating so ****ing much," he told Nick Kroll.</p><h2 id=working-out-three-times-a-week><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Working Out Three Times A Week</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McElhenney may now boast a 6 pack, but he was in a very different physical state just a few years ago. In order to get fit, he worked out 3 times a week. He would weight lift an incredible 6 days a week and run 3 miles a day, which helped him lose weight and also obtain muscle definition.</p><h2 id=this-celeb-fitness-trainer-helped-him-get-ripped><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>This Celeb Fitness Trainer Helped Him Get Ripped</span></h2><p>Arin Babaian is a celeb fitness trainer who worked with the cast of Magic Mike.&nbsp;Since Babaian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helped get Channing Tatum in shape</a>, McElhenney figured that he could help him, too.</p><p>Babaian got McElhenney to do incline dumbbell presses, high cable chest flyes, bench presses, and cable rotations to get into shape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-the-diet-was-brutal><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>But The Diet&nbsp;Was Brutal</span></h2><p>McElhenney has been honest about his fitness journey. To lose the 60 lbs he had gained to play "Fat Mac", he had to endure a gruelling and brutal diet.&nbsp; "Do you like food? Forget about that. Because you're never going to enjoy anything you eat. Alcohol? Sorry. That's out. So what you need to do - you have a chef... make sure the chef makes you a lot of chicken breast. And make sure you keep your caloric intake at a certain level," he told Men's Health.</p><p>However, in that same interview,&nbsp;McElhenney did point out that it's men, not women, who pressure other men into getting jacked: "There's this fascination that men want to look like that and men want to be aesthetically pleasing to other men."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Don't Believe Matthew Perry's Dental Work Is The Reason For His Demeanor</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZKunkmK6pLHLoZynppWueqW1w2arqGWXlravecCnm2akn6iyboKPZqeorZ6ZwG6yzqtkoqyjYq6tw8CyqmarpaO7unnIp2SpoJmhrqWxy6mfoplf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feverything-rob-mcelhenney-did-to-gain-and-lose-60-pounds-for-its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia.html&text=Everything%20Rob%20McElhenney%20Did%20To%20Gain%20%28And%20Lose%29%2060%20Pounds%20For%20%27It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-rob-mcelhenney-did-to-gain-and-lose-60-pounds-for-its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-rob-mcelhenney-did-to-gain-and-lose-60-pounds-for-its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia.html&title=Everything%20Rob%20McElhenney%20Did%20To%20Gain%20%28And%20Lose%29%2060%20Pounds%20For%20%27It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feverything-rob-mcelhenney-did-to-gain-and-lose-60-pounds-for-its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia.html&title=Everything%20Rob%20McElhenney%20Did%20To%20Gain%20%28And%20Lose%29%2060%20Pounds%20For%20%27It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feverything-rob-mcelhenney-did-to-gain-and-lose-60-pounds-for-its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia.html&title=Everything%20Rob%20McElhenney%20Did%20To%20Gain%20%28And%20Lose%29%2060%20Pounds%20For%20%27It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-rob-mcelhenney-did-to-gain-and-lose-60-pounds-for-its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia.html&description=Everything%20Rob%20McElhenney%20Did%20To%20Gain%20%28And%20Lose%29%2060%20Pounds%20For%20%27It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fresh-and-fit-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fresh and Fit Net Worth  How Much Is Fresh and Fit Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./american-airlines-is-growing-at-its-clt-hub.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="American Airlines is growing at its CLT hub  WSOC TV">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
