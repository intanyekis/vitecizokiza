The actor recently made headlines for his return appearance in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Whale</a>.</p><p>At the beginning of Fraser’s career in 1993, the couple first met; they later were married on September 27, 1998.</p><p>A few years later, in 2002, Fraser and Smith gave birth to their first child, Griffin Arthur Fraser. They welcomed Holden Fletcher Fraser and Leland Francis Fraser in 2004 and 2006, respectively. They advance in age.</p><p>Fraser and Smith divorced in December 2007, although they have remained co-parents of their kids. In a 2018 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ interview</a>, Fraser said his kids come to visit him “<strong>all the time</strong>.”</p><p>After their divorce, Griffin and his siblings stayed with their mother, while their father had to pay alimony for child support. However, Brendan attempted to reduce the size of his $900,000 maintenance after several years.</p><p>The proud father of three children is Brendan Fraser. Recently, the actor gained notoriety for his comeback performance in The Whale. Along with his ex-wife Alfon Smith, he has three boys.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Whale&nbsp;</h2><p>Although Fraser doesn’t talk much about his children, he occasionally discusses them in interviews. His sons Holden and Leland most recently made a rare public appearance when they went with director Fraser to a screening of his upcoming movie The Whale.</p><p>At the screening of his most recent show on December 9, Brendan Fraser came with his teenage sons, Leland and Holden Fraser, two sons.</p><p>On December 9, in New York, the actor promoted his film, “<strong>The Whale</strong>.” His movie, well-received at film festivals, will eventually enter theatres.&nbsp;</p><p>After taking a long break from acting in films, he was featured in TV shows.</p><p>The Whale, a famous stage play, will be adapted into a movie, and he will star in it, it was reported in 2021. He portrays Charlie, an obscenely overweight English professor attempting to connect with his resentful daughter Ellie (Sink).</p><p>Aronofsky is the director, and Hunter wrote both the original play and the cinematic adaptation. The forthcoming film also features Hong Chau and Samantha Morten as co-stars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Griffin Arthur Fraser</h2><p>Fraser and Smith welcomed Griffin, their first child, on September 17, 2002. Fraser disclosed that Griffin has autism in an interview with GQ in 2018.</p><p>Griffin, Brendan Fraser’s eldest son, falls on the autism spectrum. Growing up, he needed the extra care and attention he received alongside mounts of love from those who surrounded him.</p><p>Although Griffin lives with his mom, Brendan’s ex-wife Afton Smith, in Greenwich, Connecticut, he often visits his father’s home.</p><p>He also has no social media accounts, which makes knowing more about his personal life difficult. However, little news about him broke in the press over the years. His father also said, “<strong>He needs more love in the world, and he gets it</strong>.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holden Fletcher Fraser</h2><p>On August 16, 2004, Fraser and Smith gave birth to their son Holden. Fraser discussed his younger sons’ unique <a href=#>relationship</a> with Griffin.</p><p>The youngest is Leland Francis Fraser, who was born in 2006. Leland grew up outside of the spotlight like his brothers.</p><p>In a 2010 interview on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Rachel Ray Show</a>, Brendan revealed that Leland was a “<strong>professional fireplug. He passes through briers and undergrowth, emerging scratched but happy. It’s all good!</strong>”</p><p>Further, he said, <strong>“I always hug and kiss them whether they like it or not. I’m like, ‘Come here, you,’ and you blow raspberries on them. That’s what I do.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Leland Fletcher Fraser</h2><p>Fraser and Smith welcomed their youngest son, Leland, on May 2, 2006. In a February 2010 appearance on The Rachael Ray Show, Fraser called his youngest child “<strong>a professional fire plug</strong>.”</p><p>In a January 2009 interview, Fraser stated that becoming a father has taught him <strong>“how to love more and more every day.”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCu0Z6lnZmeYrOzrdKeqWajmZnAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrendan-fraser-kids.html&text=Brendan%20Fraser%20Kids%20%20All%20Details%20About%20His%20Sons&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrendan-fraser-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrendan-fraser-kids.html&title=Brendan%20Fraser%20Kids%20%20All%20Details%20About%20His%20Sons" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrendan-fraser-kids.html&title=Brendan%20Fraser%20Kids%20%20All%20Details%20About%20His%20Sons" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrendan-fraser-kids.html&title=Brendan%20Fraser%20Kids%20%20All%20Details%20About%20His%20Sons" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrendan-fraser-kids.html&description=Brendan%20Fraser%20Kids%20%20All%20Details%20About%20His%20Sons" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-april-1-through-12-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Days of Our Lives Spoilers April 1, 2024 Through April 12, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./becky-g-shares-her-patron-paloma-recipe-for-cinco-de-mayo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Becky G Shares Her Patron Paloma Recipe for Cinco de Mayo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
