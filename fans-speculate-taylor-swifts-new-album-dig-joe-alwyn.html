Of course she would do so after one of her longest relationships ended. Now that she has a new album coming, one that she has been working on for a couple of years, fans can't help but wonder if she will be exposing some details about her and Joe Alwyn's breakup. Especially after she chose such a particular title for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=swifties-were-expecting-a-special-announcement>Swifties Were Expecting A Special Announcement</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-81st-annual-golden-globe-awards.jpg><p>Taylor Swift is known for leaving Easter eggs to hint to her fans whenever she has a new announcement, and through the years, Swifties have gotten incredibly good at spotting them and guessing what they mean. Because of this, they have become hyper aware, and sometimes they get carried away, seeing hints where there aren't. Despite this, they can usually tell when something new is coming, but Taylor still manages to surprise everyone.</p><p>For a couple of years now, she has been re-recording her past albums as a way to reclaim them after her lengthy legal battle with Scooter Braun. The only two albums left for her to re-record are her debut album, Taylor Swift, and her iconic reputation. For a while now, Swifties have been speculating on the re-release of Reputation, so when on the day of the Grammys Taylor changed her profile picture to a black and white photo, matching that album's aesthetic, they got excited about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They were half right. The singer did use the Grammys to make an announcement, but it was something different and bigger. <a href=#>She shared with the audience that she was putting out a new album,</a> which would be called The Tortured Poets Department. It will be out on April 19th.</p><h2 id=fans-think-taylor-is-taking-a-dig-at-joe-alwyn>Fans Think Taylor Is Taking A Dig At Joe Alwyn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/joe-alwyn-london-premiere-of-catherine-called-birdy-and-paul-mescal-andrew-scott-london-critics-circle-film-awards.jpg><p>In 2022, it was revealed that Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn had split up after six years together. After that, every song Taylor released was overanalyzed, and fans looked for clues about when the relationship started going sour. In November 2023, Taylor's producer and good friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Antonoff posted a story</a> about the official release of the song 'You're Losing Me', sharing that she wrote it and recorded it in mid-2021 at his house, so that's when fans speculate they started having trouble in their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t095022-884.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How">Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's relationship with her dad and mom and their separation was the inspiration for some her best songs, including 'The Best Day'.</p><p>During her announcement at the Grammys, Taylor said that she had been working on the new album for two years, which only fueled the rumors, and when she published the name, fans became convinced that she was taking a dig at the actor.</p><p>Years ago, Joe Alwyn shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had a group chat with Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott</a>, which they dubbed the "Tortured Man Club." With Taylor Swift's new album being called The Tortured Poets Department and the fact that she started writing it around the time of the breakup, fans are convinced the record will be filled with Joe Alwyn references.
