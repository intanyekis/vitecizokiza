Nowadays, Leno has a worth of $450 million and chances are, he was able to retain a lot of that money. Fans have praised Leno for being humble with the way he lives and, in addition, he confirmed a crazy urban legend speaking alongside Adam Carolla. Leno confirmed that he never touched any of his Tonight Show money.</p><p><strong>Carolla asks, "The legend is, is that you always kept all those Tonight Show checks. And made your money doing live performances."</strong></p><p>Leno did not hesitate when revealing that was completely true.</p><p>Leno says, "You got to be hungry. I used to live week to week. I lived on the money I made as a standup. I wanted to be a comedian. I never thought TV was a job that would last you."</p><p>Leno went on to confirm that he never touched any of his Tonight Show salary "until the very end."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carolla was stunned by the response, especially given Leno's habits of spending on cars, and giving back to his Tonight Show employees back in the day.</p><p>Leno was able to not only survive, but confirmed that the money is still there in an account.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jay-leno-claimed-he-did-nothing-wrong-to-david_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jay Leno Claimed He Did Nothing Wrong To David Letterman After Decades Of Feuding On Late Night">Jay Leno Claimed He Did Nothing Wrong To David Letterman After Decades Of Feuding On Late Night</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jay Leno doesn't think he was the villain of his feud with David Letterman over who would host The Tonight Show.</p><p>A remarkable story of how Leno was able to maintain his wealth all these years later.

And in fact, a lot of them shared their personal experiences with the late night host. Not a single negative experience was shared.</p><p>Fans wrote, "Lot of people in LA have a Jay story. Bumped into him once at the only gas station in Beverly Hills, he was filling up up an old banged up Indian motorcycle he was riding around on. I commented on his bike and he just chatted with me for 20 minutes like we were bros. Jay is good people."</p><p>"I was on a flight with Jay Leno - sat next to him for the entire flight. He was a "regular" guy on the plane. No one to meet him at the baggage claim - got his own luggage got on the same bus to the hotel with everyone else. All while doing the Tonight Show. Wore pretty much what he has on in this video.

You know, when you start making money, you get lazy. I wanted to make sure I always had that hunger, so I never looked.
