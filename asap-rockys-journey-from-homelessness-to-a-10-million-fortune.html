His mother is an African-American, and&nbsp; his father was born in Barbados. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He currently leads a life of abundance that is filled with privilege and great fortune</a>, but that hasn't always been the case for the young artist. He started rapping at the tender age of just 9 years old, but what he didn't realize at the time, was that his success would be a long road, and the first part of his journey would be a painful one.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When Rocky was just 12 years old, his&nbsp;father was incarcerated for selling drugs.</a> The family was deeply affected, and just a year later, when Rocky was just 13, his brother Ricky was murdered by a rival drug dealer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna Is Pregnant And Her First Child Will Be Born Into Her $1.7 Billion Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=homelessness-and-crime>Homelessness And Crime</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A$AP Rocky&nbsp;was overwhelmed with grief and loss, and he was watching his family fall apart.
