He went to work with his mother, who was a stylist for advertisements when he was about six years old.</p><p>He saw what the actors were doing there and found it interesting. He went home and told his mom that all he wanted to do was act. And as luck would have it, he secured his first acting project in the television film ‘Extraordinary Measures’ later that year with none other than Brendan Fraser and <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Harrison Ford" href=# data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Harrison Ford</a>.</p><p>Born on the 5th of December 2001 Diego Velazquez is currently 21 years old.
