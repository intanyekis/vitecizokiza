During a conversation with People Magazine, the former host of America's Got Talent went into detail about balancing her professional life and motherhood following the birth of her baby with Erik Asla.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyra Banks and Erik Asla continue co-parenting their son despite their breakup in 2017. Erik is a well-known photographer from Norway. Bazaar, ELLE, Glamour, Interview, The New York Times Magazine, and Vanity Fair featured Erik's work.

With very few posts about her son on her social media, she now has her fans guessing the reasons behind keeping it secret. It now seems convenient for her fans to label Tyra Banks as a strict mother for keeping her life with her son private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyra-banks-39-difficult-path-to-motherhood>Tyra Banks' Difficult Path to Motherhood</h2><p>Tyra Banks once mentioned how tired she was seeing questions like why she did not have kids on her social media. She admitted that she continued postponing becoming a mother year after year since she was 23. However, when the idea seemed to make sense, and she was ready to accept motherhood, she could not conceive naturally.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The road to getting York Banks Asla via surrogacy after seven failed cycles of IVF</a> was like grasping at straws. Her mother Carolyn London said that during this challenging phase, Tyra had added a tile in her bathroom that said,” ‘Mommy Already Loves You.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was reported that Tyra Banks was giving herself stimulation shots during the shoot of cycle 22 of America’s Next Top Model. It continued till Cycle 22’s final runway. She remembered taking her final shot in a back closet at the Disney Concert Hall. Talking about her experience with IVF, she pointed out that her struggle and finding the balance between trying for a baby and work commitments made her body fall apart. So, when York Banks Asla arrived in her life, her joy knew no bounds.</p><h2 id=tyra-banks-39-s-routine-changed-after-york-banks-asla-rsquo-s-birth>Tyra Banks's Routine Changed After York Banks Asla’s Birth</h2><p>Despite being a public figure, Tyra Banks did not fail to play the role of a perfect mother from the very moment her son York Banks Asla was born. She made changes to her getting dressed routine to fit into the world of her son.</p><p>Talking about her new routine, she mentioned that her son was getting clingier to her when he was growing. That made her start doing things much faster. She even mentioned her sleepless nights when her son was teething. She would get up with a swollen face and sunken eyes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To her, it was all about finding the right balance and doing one thing at the moment.

During Covid-19, Tyra Banks posted a colored picture of York Banks Asla on social media, and her caption hinted at her homeschooling her little kid. It shows how concerned and eager she was to make sure that her child did not miss school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Tyra likes to keep it private, she does not mind showing off York's talent like any proud mother. In one of her posts in 2021, she shared a video of York busting some rhymes about lettuce wraps in a rap style. She captions the video with, "Food tastes even better when you sing about it with the fam...
