Well, it seems that <a href=#>keeping their relationship under the radar</a> and extremely private has&nbsp;been&nbsp;one of their best moves yet. Instead of constantly talking about one another to the press and posting a ton of photos on social media, these stars like to remain out of the spotlight as much as they can, and it has proven to work well for these celebs.</p><h2 id=dave-franco-and-alison-brie><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dave Franco And Alison Brie</span></h2><p>Did anyone know that <a href=#>Dave Franco was a married man?</a> The actor has kept his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship with actress Alison Brie out of the public eye</a> for some time that most people didn't even realize that they had been together for nearly a decade before tying the knot in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Sofia Richie's Dating History</a></span></p><p>Brie admitted that she never really wanted to get married, but that all changed when she met Franco when she shared, "It was not a priority for me and I may have just been fine never getting married except that, you know, I fell madly in love and then thought, 'Oh, I guess I could be married to you.'"</p><h2 id=margot-robbie-and-tom-ackerley><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Margot Robbie And Tom Ackerley</span></h2><p>Actress <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> has been in several box office hits, but not much is known about her private life with her husband of nearly six years Tom Ackerly. It appears the couple likes to keep their marriage super low-key, but Ackerly has always been spotted attending red carpet events with his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Robbie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ackerly works in Hollywood</a> as an assistant director and producer who founded his own production company with his wife called LuckyChap Entertainment which has produced movies like&nbsp;I, Tonya, and Hulu's&nbsp;Dollface.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=zoe-saldana-and-marco-perego><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Zoe Saldana And Marco Perego</span></h2><p>Actress <a href=#>Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego</a> are happily raising three children together, but fans may not have known that since this Hollywood couple likes to keep their marriage private. The two have been married since 2013 and it looks like not talking about their ups and downs with the press has seemed to work well for them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Really Happened Between Frank Sinatra And Mia Farrow?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Saldana knew it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">love at first sight</a> for her when she shared with Marie Claire, "I don't do the ABCs, I do what my heart says, what my heart feels.
