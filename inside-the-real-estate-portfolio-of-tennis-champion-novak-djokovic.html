After six years, young Djokovic moved to Germany to train under Nikola Pilić and participated in junior tournaments. After turning pro in 2003, it was a slow and steady rise for Djokovic, who eventually won his first major Grand Slam in 2008 at the Australian Open. Since then, he has won 21 Grand Slam titles and <a href=#>collected $150 million in prize money</a>, the most amount for any player in tennis history. Through his brand endorsements and partnership, Djokovic makes additional millions.</p><p>With a net worth of over $220 million, Novak Djokovic has become one of the wealthiest tennis players and is considered one of the greatest of all time. His hefty net worth allows him to spend on expensive cars and family vacations. The tennis player has been known to buy many real estate properties since winning his first Grand Slam. Let us take a look at the real estate legacy of Novak Djokovic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=childhood-home>Childhood Home</h2><p>A Serbian native, Novak Djokovic comes from a humble background in Serbia, where he lived with his parents in Belgrade. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine</a>, his grandparents resided in a modest concrete building block with traditional flats. The window of his apartment overlooked a parking lot for the residents. A football park where he often played with his friends was adjoining the building. He lived close to now-retired Serbian football player Neven Markovic.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Tennis Superstar Novak Djokovic's Luxurious Car Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=two-soho-apartments>Two SoHo Apartments</h2><p>Moving to his real estate in the United States, Novak Djokovic paid $10 million to buy two apartments in the expensive SoHo neighborhood in <a href=#>New York City. Famous architect</a> Renzo Piano designed the interior of the building, and each of his condos features two bedrooms, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>. The apartments he purchased are not located on a single floor, meaning they were not combined into a single unit. The 30-story apartment finished its construction in 2018, and the two towers with 115 units opened for residents.</p><h2 id=monte-carlo-residence>Monte Carlo Residence</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star athlete first visited Monte Carlo when he was 17 years old and trained with his couch for a short period. He began spending significant time in the city due to his tournaments and the coach’s residence in the area. His house is on a hillside property that offers stunning Mediterranean sea views. As the city is home to many tennis athletes and sports professionals, it allows Djokovic easier access to tennis centers for practice and is spotted at the Monte Carlo Country Club.</p><h2 id=marbella-home>Marbella Home</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Novak Djokovic made Monte Carlo his primary residence for over a decade, he moved with his young family to Marbella in 2020. He spent the initial months of the pandemic with his family at the $10 million mansion. The home has a Moroccan-style interior with nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>. The luxurious home is often seen on Instagram, and Djokovic has been snapped practicing tennis with his children on the tennis court. Along with offering scenic views of the mountain and sea, the Marbella home has multiple jacuzzies, a sauna, a Turkish bath, and a private spa.</p><h2 id=miami-penthouse>Miami Penthouse</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every year Novak Djokovic plays the Miami Open, and the athlete often takes a rest at his Miami penthouse at Eighty-Seven Park. The penthouse is another famous creation by Renzo Piano and features three bedrooms. As mentioned by <a href=#>GQ</a>, the penthouse is equipped with various amenities, including stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean and Miami Parkland. <a href=#>The building has an infinity pool</a>, valet-on-service, spa, gym, library, and a botanical bar. The expensive apartment is located on one of the most exclusive streets of Miami and is home to many celebrities and businesspeople.</p><h2 id=belgrade-apartment>Belgrade Apartment</h2><p>A Belgrade native, Novak Djokovic decided to buy an apartment in his hometown in 2018. The tennis star purchased a penthouse for $675,000 that overlooks Lake Pavlova. It is located in one of the most expensive buildings in the city and features three bedrooms. Additional rooms in the home include a kitchen, a large family room, and three bathrooms. The building has a terrace pool for Djokovic and his family to enjoy. It is also reported that he purchased another apartment that he gave to his friend Filip Krajinovic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From penthouses in the United States to cozy homes in Europe, Novak Djokovic has a substantial real estate portfolio that spans cities vital to him. While many of the houses are located in locations for tournaments, other homes relate to his country of Serbia. As the tennis star looks for more avenues to invest, he will soon be seen buying more properties for his young family.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside David Beckham's Insane Car Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ506GcZqqVlrlusdKtmK2dXaW8s8DFqKOip12ks27AxKeloqtdmLWiuc%2BipqdlnqTDoreMnaGoo5%2BrtqR7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-the-real-estate-portfolio-of-tennis-champion-novak-djokovic.html&text=Inside%20The%20Real%20Estate%20Portfolio%20Of%20Tennis%20Champion%20Novak%20Djokovic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-the-real-estate-portfolio-of-tennis-champion-novak-djokovic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-real-estate-portfolio-of-tennis-champion-novak-djokovic.html&title=Inside%20The%20Real%20Estate%20Portfolio%20Of%20Tennis%20Champion%20Novak%20Djokovic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-the-real-estate-portfolio-of-tennis-champion-novak-djokovic.html&title=Inside%20The%20Real%20Estate%20Portfolio%20Of%20Tennis%20Champion%20Novak%20Djokovic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-real-estate-portfolio-of-tennis-champion-novak-djokovic.html&title=Inside%20The%20Real%20Estate%20Portfolio%20Of%20Tennis%20Champion%20Novak%20Djokovic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-the-real-estate-portfolio-of-tennis-champion-novak-djokovic.html&description=Inside%20The%20Real%20Estate%20Portfolio%20Of%20Tennis%20Champion%20Novak%20Djokovic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./naya-rivera-claims-she-found-ariana-grande-at-big-seans-w439663.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Naya Rivera Claims She Found Ariana Grande at Big Seans">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-open-laura-mercier-powder.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to open laura mercier powder">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
