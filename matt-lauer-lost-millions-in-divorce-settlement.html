The sum Lauer was due to pay was ultimately quite the number.</p><h2 id=matt-lauer-and-annette-roque-are-on-better-terms-today>Matt Lauer And Annette Roque Are On Better Terms Today</h2><p>Once the allegations started coming in, it wasn't long after that Annette Roque and Matt Lauer ended their relationship. Things were taken care of on private terms, with Roque and Lauer agreeing on a massive settlement.</p><p>It appears as though things were done on amicable terms as according to Page Six most recently, <a href=#>Lauer and Roque were spotted together at their daughter's high school graduation</a>. According to the publication, the two seemed to be getting along just fine.</p><p>"The disgraced “Today” show host and his ex seemed to be on good terms as they reunited, greeting each other before Romy’s ceremony in East Hampton, New York, on Sunday."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matt Lauer Once Wanted To Get Into A "Wrestling Match" With This A-List Star</a></span></p><p>Of course, it is entirely possible that Lauer's team purposely set things up as such, in a way to repair his image. <a href=#>Lauer has not been successful in defending himself in recent years</a>, even regretting keeping quiet. "Over the past two years people have asked why I have not spoken out to defend myself more vigorously against some of the false and salacious allegations leveled at me. It is a fair question and the answer is deeply personal."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Despite my desire to set the record straight and confront the individuals making false allegations, I wanted nothing less than to create more headlines my kids would read and a new gathering of photographers at the end of our driveway. But my silence has been a mistake."</p><p>In addition, Lauer has played the blame game, stating that most of the stories were exaggerated.</p><h2 id=the-finalized-divorce-settlement-saw-matt-lauer-fork-over-20-million-in-assets>The Finalized Divorce Settlement Saw Matt Lauer Fork Over $20 Million In Assets</h2><p>Back in 2019, Page Six discussed the details of the finalized divorce. It should not come as a surprise, Lauer has forced in handing over several assets. It is said that Lauer wanted to ensure the best possible scenario for his ex. By the end of it, <a href=#>Roque walked away with over $20 million of their assets.</a></p><p>"We then revealed Lauer was “bending over backward” to give Roque — the mother of his three kids — everything she wanted in their divorce, according to friends. But the deal was not finalized till now."</p><p>"We’re told Roque gets up to $20 million in assets, and she’ll get to keep their Hamptons horse farm in Water Mill," Page Six stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reports were conflicting however, as other platforms made mention that Lauer was not happy with the end settlement result.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Where Do Katie Couric And Matt Lauer Stand Today?</a></span></p><p>There was another major question mark for the couple, and that was their massive estate in the Hamptons.

In recent years, the former Today Show host brought down the price significantly, which once started at $65 million. Ultimately, according to Daily Mail, he got nowhere near that sum for the stunning estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The luxe mansion, which features 12 bedrooms, two guest houses, a heated swimming pool and sweeping views of Peconic Bay, was bought by Lauer in 2016 from Pretty Woman actor Richard Gere in 2016 for $36.5 million - a steep discount from the $65 million the actor was originally looking for."</p><p>It remains to be seen what will take place with the funds of the residence, nonetheless, it is a some good news for Lauer, finally unloading the property.
