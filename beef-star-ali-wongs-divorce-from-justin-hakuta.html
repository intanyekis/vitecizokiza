When stars go through a divorce, the situation can become overwhelming and difficult very quickly. That doesn't seem to be the case with this particular divorce, however. Here's what to know about Ali Wong and Justin Hakuta's divorce and why it stands out from many other splits.</p><h2 id=inside-ali-wong-and-justin-hakuta-39-s-marriage>Inside Ali Wong And Justin Hakuta's Marriage</h2><p>People are curious about <a href=#>the money that Justin Hakuta will get</a> now that he and Ali Wong have gotten divorced. Since the pair was married for almost ten years, it makes sense that people are so invested in what went wrong between them and what their relationship is like now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to People, Justin Hakuta and Ali Wong got married in November 2014 after they started dating in 2010. They have two daughters: nine-year-old Nikki Hakuta and seven-year-old Mari Hakuta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ali-wong-and-her-ex-husband-justin-hakuta-at-the-2016-bcbg-make-a-wish-fashion-show.jpg><p>In April 2022, People reported that the pair were getting divorced. As a source explained, "It's amicable and they will continue to co-parent lovingly."</p><p>No other reason was given as to why the couple broke up. It doesn't seem that anything terrible happened. If it did, though, neither one has said anything about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Wong did talk about her husband in her comedy specials and joked about being jealous of people who aren't in relationships, she also sounded really happy to be married to Hakuta. She often talked about him on her Instagram account. According to Nextshark.com, she posted on Instagram in 2019 and said of Hakuta, “He’s a sexy a** man that drives a minivan and eats Durian and appreciates Killing Eve just as much as I do!”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Ali Wong's Husband Justin Hakuta Doing Now That They're Divorced?</a></span></p><p>The couple started dating in 2010, which was one year before Ali Wong's acting career really took off.</p><p>In 2011, she played Ana Ng in three episodes of the sitcom Breaking In. In 2012, she played Olivia in 12 episodes of Chelsea Handler's sitcom Are You There, Chelsea?

They are filled with so many different emotions, and it can be hard to think about the future. In the case of stars getting divorced, it often seems like they start fighting about money and who gets what. When so much cash is on the line, it makes sense that people would be upset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Ali Wong and Justin Hakuta seem to be getting along really well. As far as divorces go, this must be one of the best. It seems that they have made a conscious effort to ensure that things are going smoothly.

The comedian and actress explained that she doesn't think that the divorce is all that fascinating.

When we said that we were lovingly co-parenting and focusing on the kids, we really meant it. That wasn’t just a statement. To me, that’s kind of boring. And in terms of my act, and what I choose to talk about, how I decide for myself is all instinct. I can always feel if it’s too much."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Christine Baumgartner Really Believe She Would Keep Living In Kevin Costner's $145 Million Santa Barbara House After Filing For Divorce?</a></span></p><p>She also said, "Up until recently, my personal life was actually quite boring" and mentioned that having paparazzi snap pictures has been "strange."</p><p>In her interview with The Cut, Wong also said that she makes sure to keep many parts of her personal life out of her comedy act. She said that she would never make fun of her in-laws in a special or when doing stand-up.</p><p>It's clear that Wong and Hakuta still care a lot about each other, and she wants to be compassionate now that they have split up. She said, "Never for a minute with Justin do I feel like I don’t still need him. He’s the father of my kids. He’s my best friend. I need him desperately, and I need to respect him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ali-wong-in-beef.jpg><p>According to Us Weekly, Ali Wong and Bill Hader started a relationship in 2022.
