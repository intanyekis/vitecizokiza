On the 90-minute live premiere episode, the 16 houseguests will move in in groups of four. From there, they will be thrown into a competition. The person who finishes first in each group will assume the role of team captain. From there, they will be divided into four groups of four, which will be chosen by the team captains, and the houseguests will stay in them for the first four weeks of the competition. A new Head of Household will be crowned by the end of the premiere.</p><p>So, who exactly are the Big Brother 23 houseguests?
