比較的に知名度が低いJ(小野瀬潤)さんですが、
調べれば調べるほど魅力な方だとわかります。
中学生の頃に、
INORANさんと出会い、
その出会いがLUNA SEA誕生につながってます。
またはhideさんとお揃いの刺青があるなど、
ヴィジュアル系の歴史の中で、
重要なポジションにいる方だというのがわかります。
Jさんは日本でも有数のベーシストとして、
玄人受けの方が良いのも特徴で、
LUNA SEAの名声に厚みを増してます。
しかし、プライベートに脚光が浴びることはなく、
かなり謎の部分が多いです。
既婚者であることや、
子供がいることも、
ファンぐらいしかしらないでしょう・・・。
J(小野瀬潤)の嫁と子供(シャチハタ)
現在のルナシーでは、
河村隆一さんが結婚するなど、
既婚者率はぐっと上がってますが、
J(小野瀬潤)さんが結婚したのは比較的遅めです。
結婚したのは４０歳目前でしたので、
多くの人が一生音楽が嫁的な、
独身貴族を貫くと思っていたことでしょう。
某掲示板ではJさんの嫁さんは、
シャチハタなんて関連キーワードに引っ張られてますが・・・、
これは良い意味なのか、悪い意味なのか・・・。
また、結婚話は２０１０年頃にあったので、
嫁さんの年齢はまだ２０代だったはずなので、
今頃に子供が生まれていてもおかしくないでしょう。
スギゾーさんや河村さんや真矢さんのように、
著名人の嫁をもらってる方は、
すぐに子供の誕生が報じられますが、
一般人だと言われてるJさんとINORANさんに関しては、
公式なソースからの情報がなく、
子供は全て憶測として言いようがないです。
結婚から７年前後経っているので、
すでに子供がいても・・・、
いや、今更公表する必要もないですかね？
Jと今井りかと常盤貴子とファンへの片思いの噂 かつてJさんの嫁に、
今井りかさん説がありました。
しかし、これは、
ファンが掲示板にて、
「今井りか似」と表現されただけです。
この噂に関しては、
今井さんのファン側が、
「え？そんなすごい人と結婚してたの？」と、
混乱を招いたことでしょう！笑
また、常盤貴子さんに関しても、
過去の彼女の顔の系統が似ていたことで、
某掲示板でファンが「似てる」と書いただけで、
実際に付き合っていた過去はありません。
またまたは、
ファンに片思いしてるという噂は・・・？
これはどっかの小説で、
仮に作られた話とかがあったんですかね？
女性に困ることもなさそうなので、
ファンに片思いするシチュエーションはないでしょう。
しかし、過去に片思いを語ったことはあるというのですが、
その相手は絶対にファンではないことでしょう。
公式なソースが薄いので、
書いてて、空虚になりますね。笑
