Of course, there are also grandmothers who don’t fit this mold at all. Some grandmas are known for taking their grandchildren on adventures like camping trips and concerts that actually feature current artists. There are also grandmas who are a combination of classic and current. You know you’ll always get a great home-cooked meal when you go to her house, but she’s also more than willing to accompany you to your favorite boutique&nbsp;so you can pick out a fabulous first date outfit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s also important to remember that grandmothers come in all ages. While it used to be the trend for celebrities to wait until they were in their late 30s or early 40s to have children, some celebs are having kids during their younger years. This means that Hollywood grandmothers are getting younger as well. These celebrities are likely shopping at the same stores as their daughters, wearing similar hairstyles, and even enjoying some of the same music and movies.&nbsp;Here are some of the youngest grandmothers in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=marie-osmond>10. Marie Osmond</h2><p><a href=#>Marie Osmond</a>, who is now 55, has been in the spotlight for most of her life. That’s likely why she felt completely comfortable announcing to the world that her son and daughter-in-law were expecting their first child during her appearance on The Talk, in 2013. Osmond stated that she was so excited about becoming a grandmother, and couldn’t wait to meet her grandchild. It wouldn’t be surprising if the little one grows up with a natural talent for singing and dancing. Since Marie and her brother Donnie, will probably be performing in Vegas (or some other large venue) off and on for the rest of their lives, the little “Osmond” (whose father is Steven Craig) may want to join Grandma and great-uncle Donnie for an on-stage sing-a-long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=naomi-judd>9. Naomi Judd</h2><p>Country superstar <a href=#>Naomi Judd</a> became a grandmother in 1994, when she was 48. Her daughter <a href=#>Wynonna</a>, fellow country superstar and the other half of the duo The Judds, gave birth to her son Elijah that year. He refers to his grandmother as Mawmaw. Naomi, now 69, is thrilled to have Elijah in her life, and has stated that being a grandmother is as big an accomplishment to her as winning her seven Grammy Awards. She even shares that being Elijah’s grandmother is just as important to her as being a New York Times best-selling author and being a mother, too.</p><p></p><h2 id=goldie-hawn>8. Goldie Hawn</h2><p><a href=#>Goldie Hawn</a>&nbsp;(69 years old) became a grandmother for the first time when her daughter <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>, gave birth to a son named Ryder in 2004. She has since had three other grandchildren from Kate and Kate’s brother Oliver. Hawn is a veteran actress whose grandchildren will likely be proud to hear about her accomplishments one day. She is known for her work on classic television shows like <i>Laugh-In</i>, and appeared in the film <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>. Hawn has also spoken in recent interviews about being fearless and living one’s best life, and how these principles have helped her achieve success. Looks like she’s got some great lessons to teach her grandchildren.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=sharon-osbourne>7. Sharon Osbourne</h2><p>In the early 2000s, <a href=#>Sharon Osbourne</a> made a name for herself as the loving mom with the potty mouth on the MTV reality show, <i>The Osbournes</i>. Osbourne has calmed down a little since then, and it may be due to the birth of her granddaughter Pearl, in 2012. Pearl is <a href=#>Jack Osbourne’s</a> daughter; Jack and his wife have since had another child. When Sharon, 62, isn’t doting on her grandchildren, she’s giving her opinions about celebrities and current events as one of the hosts of <i>The Talk</i>. Sharon Osbourne has also worked as a spokesperson for the Atkins Diet, an eating plan that has helped her lose a considerable amount of weight. Her new body makes her look anything but matronly.</p><p></p><h2 id=kris-jenner>6. Kris Jenner</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The matriarch of the Kardashian clan became a grandmother when she was in her early 50s. Her first grandchild was Mason, her daughter <a href=#>Kourtney’s</a> son. Kourtney later had another son and daughter. <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a>, who is now 59, is also a grandmother to <a href=#>Kim’s</a> daughter North with husband <a href=#>Kanye West</a>. Kris is certainly one of the most stylish grandmothers in Hollywood, and while she has just as many critics as fans, there’s no denying that she’s good at what she does. After all, she’s created a pretty lucrative family empire, and helped to turn her daughter Kim’s reputation around after a sex tape was released years ago that featured Kim and her then-boyfriend, <a href=#>Ray J</a>. Kris has stated that she’s ecstatic to be a grandmother, and loves her grandchildren dearly.</p><p></p><h2 id=priscilla-presley>5. Priscilla Presley</h2><p><a href=#>Priscilla Presley</a> is still best known for being the wife of the late music legend <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>. Elvis and Priscilla only had one child, a daughter named <a href=#>Lisa Marie</a>. In 1989, Lisa Marie made Priscilla a grandmother for the first time when she gave birth to a daughter named Riley. Priscilla was 44 at the time. Priscilla now has three more grandchildren. However, Priscilla would prefer that her grandchildren refer to her as Nona, which is the Italian version of “grandmother.” She states that there’s a certain connotation with the word “grandma” that she doesn’t care for. Presley is now 70.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=nene-leakes>4. NeNe Leakes</h2><p>The outspoken reality star, who is one of the only original members of the <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> cast, became a grandmother in 2012, when she was 44. However, she prefers to be called “Glam-Ma.” Her adorable granddaughter, Bri’asia, even posed with her grandmother for a photo shoot, in which the two were dressed in white. <a href=#>NeNe Leakes</a> states that the news that she would become a grandmother shocked her, since she didn’t find out that her son and his girlfriend were expecting until a few months before Bri’asia was born. She adores her granddaughter, but admits she was hesitant about being a grandparent at first. However, once NeNe (47 years old) remembered how “sassy and fashion-forward” she is, she was on board.</p><p></p><h2 id=sarah-palin>3. Sarah Palin</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Sarah Palin</a> is best known for running for vice president a few years ago as part of the Republican party. She’s made some pretty…interesting comments during interviews and press conferences, and has even been spoofed on Saturday Night Live by <a href=#>Tina Fey</a> (the two actually look a lot alike). In 2008, when she was 44, Sarah Palin gave birth to her youngest son, Trig. That same year, her 18-year-old daughter <a href=#>Bristol</a>, revealed that she was pregnant. In Bristol’s memoir, she reveals that her mother thought she was playing a practical joke on her when she told her mom the news. In December of 2008, Palin, now 51, became baby Tripp’s grandmother. Bristol will be welcoming another child in this year.</p><p></p><h2 id=tina-knowles>2. Tina Knowles</h2><p><a href=#>Tina Knowles</a> was the stylist for Destiny’s Child for years, and is responsible for the sparkly and colorful outfits the girls were often seen wearing on the red carpet. In 2004, the fabulous Mrs. Knowles became a grandmother at the age of 50, when her daughter <a href=#>Solange</a>, gave birth to Juelz. Juelz enjoyed the spotlight as the only Knowles grandchild for quite some time. Then in 2012, <a href=#>Beyonce</a> gave birth to Blue Ivy, who is perhaps one of the most famous babies in the world right now. Tina was still in her 50s when Blue Ivy was born, making her a fairly young grandmother once again. It’s no surprise that both of her grandchildren are pretty stylish, and they’ll likely grow up to be pretty talented as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=whoopi-goldberg>1. Whoopi Goldberg</h2><p>Comedienne, actress and The View co-host, <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a> was quite young (20 years old) when she gave birth to her daughter, Alex. When Alex was 14, she became a mother herself to daughter Amarah, which made Whoopi a grandmother when she was in her 30s. Goldberg and her first grandchild actually share the same birthday! Whoopi now has two additional grandchildren, and has stated how much she loves them all so much. She is now also a great grandmother to a little girl who was born in 2014, but stated that she’s not going to make the youngest member of the family call her “granny.” Her great granddaughter can simply refer to her as “Whoop.” After all, Goldberg is still in her 50s.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>biography.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>styleblazer.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>hellomagazine.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2ks27Ax55ksqelo7Smv9Nmmp6klZe%2FqsDYZp6rmZ6ZurDAx56prGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrity-grandmothers.html&text=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrity%20Grandmothers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrity-grandmothers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrity-grandmothers.html&title=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrity%20Grandmothers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrity-grandmothers.html&title=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrity%20Grandmothers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrity-grandmothers.html&title=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrity%20Grandmothers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrity-grandmothers.html&description=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrity%20Grandmothers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-aniston-friends-ruin-rom-coms.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did 'Friends' Ruin Rom-Coms For Jennifer Aniston?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./trey-lyles-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trey Lyles  Bio (Wiki) ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
