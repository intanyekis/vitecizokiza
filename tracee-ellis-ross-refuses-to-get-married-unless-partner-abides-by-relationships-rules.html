Eventually, Ross said something so relatable that even Oprah couldn't stop nodding her head:</p><p>"I, like many of us, was taught to grow up dreaming of my wedding, not of my life. And I spent many years dreaming of my wedding and also waiting to be chosen.

One piece of wisdom Ross shares is about self-love, saying, "I feel like self-love is a daily reprieve. I think self-love and self-esteem come from estimable acts and loving action, both towards self and others."</p><p>This piece of wisdom explains a lot when it comes to Ross' attitude toward living life as a single woman. With Ross' healthy appearance, success, and positive attitude toward being a single woman, many people wonder what exactly her secrets are to reach that point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, lucky for us, Ross has shared her secrets on her social media under what she calls her five commandments. The first commandment is to giggle as much as possible. The second commandment is to get your sleep (Tracee: "People say sleep when you're dead. I don't agree. Sleep when you're tired!"). Commandment number three is to "drink so much water." For the fourth commandment, Ross says verbatim, "have as much sex as possible. Sorry mom, but it's true. It brings out the best in your skin." As for commandment number five, Ross says to love with an open and full heart.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/meryl-streep-hid-don-gummer-from-the-public-eye-long-before-their-separation.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Meryl Streep Hid Don Gummer Long Before Their Separation</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Meryl Streep has been fiercely protective of her family life and relationship with her now-estranged husband, Don Gummer.</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/untitled-design-1-copy-6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These commandments come from many years of Ross learning to love herself. According to Ross, being single — that is, unmarried — for so long has allowed her to develop a new perspective, contrary to what society says about single women. Aside from her monetary success, Ross believes small, daily successes should be accounted for in a woman's life. She told Oprah Winfrey that:</p><p>"It is so easy for me to feel undermined with all the accomplishments that I've had and by accomplishments, I don't mean the whopper stuff. I mean like I take the garbage out before it stinks, like, I eat food that is good for me, I get my sleep, I show up for my friends, and that makes a life very meaningful. And somehow the rug gets pulled out so quickly when people put me in the 'you should be married'."</p><p>With so many women being able to relate to Tracee Ellis Ross' societal conditioning, we will soon see a lot more self-love and a lot more marriage terms and conditions among women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mTmrJusculoKxloqTAtHnRnp2uq5WoerW7jKCcrWWdlr%2BztcSdZK6mnJrAtHnPmqmtppWneqKuyJ2crGWSrnqzscuaq6Knnqi1qrzSZqmupJWofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftracee-ellis-ross-refuses-to-get-married-unless-partner-abides-by-relationships-rules.html&text=Tracee%20Ellis%20Ross%20Refuses%20To%20Get%20Married%20Unless%20Her%20Future%20Partner%20Abides%20By%20These%20Conditions&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftracee-ellis-ross-refuses-to-get-married-unless-partner-abides-by-relationships-rules.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftracee-ellis-ross-refuses-to-get-married-unless-partner-abides-by-relationships-rules.html&title=Tracee%20Ellis%20Ross%20Refuses%20To%20Get%20Married%20Unless%20Her%20Future%20Partner%20Abides%20By%20These%20Conditions" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftracee-ellis-ross-refuses-to-get-married-unless-partner-abides-by-relationships-rules.html&title=Tracee%20Ellis%20Ross%20Refuses%20To%20Get%20Married%20Unless%20Her%20Future%20Partner%20Abides%20By%20These%20Conditions" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftracee-ellis-ross-refuses-to-get-married-unless-partner-abides-by-relationships-rules.html&title=Tracee%20Ellis%20Ross%20Refuses%20To%20Get%20Married%20Unless%20Her%20Future%20Partner%20Abides%20By%20These%20Conditions" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftracee-ellis-ross-refuses-to-get-married-unless-partner-abides-by-relationships-rules.html&description=Tracee%20Ellis%20Ross%20Refuses%20To%20Get%20Married%20Unless%20Her%20Future%20Partner%20Abides%20By%20These%20Conditions" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-alicia-etheredge-brown-bobby-brown-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Bobby Brown's Wife?
