According to an online post on Radar, the actress wanted her husband to give her more time to care for her teenage children. Regarding this, a few of the reliable sources said,</p><p>“While Jeff enjoys his crazy job and his quiet life at home when he’s not filming, his wife Lisa wants him to stay at home full-time,”</p><h2><span id=Actor_Lisa_Ann_Russell_was_previously_married_to_Gosselaar_Mark-Paul>Actor Lisa Ann Russell was previously married to Gosselaar, Mark-Paul</span></h2><p>The former model Lisa initially got to know her ex-husband Gosselaar while working on the 1993 guest spot Saved by the Bell: The College Years. Finally, three years later, in 1996, an actress and an actor exchanged vows.</p><p>After being together for 14 years, the pair called it quits in June 2010.

In a 2013 HuffPost interview, Jeff discussed his relationship with his stepchildren and stated,</p><p>Even though it may sound strange, I was thrust into their life and now I feel like a father. The impact of being a father is undiminished by the fact that they have a biological father, but it doesn’t feel strange when they address me as such.</p><p>We can infer from his words that he has without hesitation extended his arms to his wife’s children from her prior marriage.
